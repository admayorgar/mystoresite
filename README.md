# mystoresite

This is the initial version of my very first web site: My Store Site.
https://mystoresite.freeoda.com/

This project was designet to be a template adaptable to any business.
In this example, the company is about a clothing store.

First of all, in the init page you can find sales offers and tendency products; a form contact, social media links and info about the commerce.

Then in the nav bar you find the catalogs about the products of the store.
The client can register to avoid complete their own personal info every time they want to buy something.

At the end of the principal page there is the "Manager" button, it gaves acces to the administrator platform.
Where the employee of the company can edit the stock of the products, add new items or delete them, follow the orders and print the list of total, as the individual detail of each one.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy it!
